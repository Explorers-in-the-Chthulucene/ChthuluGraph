				<p>Without aiming at taming the anti-categorical nature of Haraway's thought, we thought useful and interesting to create an Ontology to try and organize the content of Staying with the trouble with the twofold aim, on the one hand, of making the stories and the thoughts contained in these pages more navigable for people, on the other hand of enhancing the reach of Haraway's connections and thought-travels by linking entities such as, people, places, events and so on, with other existing knowledge on the web. As Haraway would put it, this ontology aims at playing string figures and entangle different sources of knowledge on the web to create a resource where users can exploit digital tools to learn and play around while <a href="about.html">staying with the trouble</a>.</p>

				<h3 style="color:indigo">STAYING WITH THE TROUBLE</h3>

				<p>Donna Haraway's <i>Staying with the Trouble</i>, is a book that represents a milestone when it comes to questioning human-nature relationship, together with nature/culture division [...] where urgent challenges of our times, such as climate change, mass extinctions and human-nature relationship, together with nature/culture kantian division is questioned in favour of a feminist, ecological discourse.

				<h4 style="color:indigo":>[WHAT] Semantic Role Labelling</h4>

				<p>Taking inspiration from this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01409">"Semantic Role Labeling for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Text"</a>  we studied how tools can be used, together with heuristic methods, to produce content for an ontology that questions the general role ontology modelling, in favour of a more concrete alignment between tools, therefore providing interoperability and leading to a F.A.I.R. use of the technology.
					</p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">

				<h4 style="color:indigo">[HOW] Annotated sentences</h4>

				<p>To evaluate semantic role labeling (SRL), you would typically need a labeled dataset consisting of annotated sentences. Each annotated sentence in the dataset should include the following information: <br>


					<b>1. Sentence</b>: The original sentence or text where the SRL annotations will be applied. <br>
					<b>2. Predicate</b>: The word or phrase that expresses the action or state in the sentence. <br>
					<b>3. Arguments</b>: The words or phrases that play specific roles with respect to the predicate. These roles can include agent, patient, theme, experiencer, location, time, and many others depending on the specific SRL framework being used. <br>
					<b>4. Labels</b>: Each argument is assigned a specific label indicating its semantic role in relation to the predicate. For example, an argument labeled as "agent" denotes the entity or actor performing the action.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-md-4">

				<h4 style="color:indigo">[FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS]</h4>

				<p>Our intent was to use both manually annotated dataset to see the performance of our software and booknlp way of working. This would have brought us evaluating the performance of a SRL-system-of-tools, using varoius metrics, such as precision, recall and F1 score.
					We leave that "for future generation". In this project indeed, you will still find mixed methods, but with an initial approach to NLP text mining and labelling.

<a href="https://github.com/Explorers-in-the-Chthulucene/SemioticDrifting/blob/main/workflow.ipynb">Find here</a> the documentation of this step as well as the visualization of the book's extracted topics.</p>
				<h4 style="color:black">[Named Entity Recognition, POS tagging, dependency and more]</h4>
				<p>We used <a href="https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp">BookNLP</a> natural language processing pipeline that scales to books and other long documents (in English). To fully annotate the text and extract its main entities as well as their relations and dependencies.

					<strong>The pipeline produces <a href="https://github.com/Explorers-in-the-Chthulucene/SemioticDrifting/tree/main/script">6 files</a>: Tokens, Entities, Supersense, Quotes (csv) and two Book files (json and html).</strong>

				<strong>For this reason we decided to concentrate only on one chapter, Chapter 7: A Curious Practice and manually correct the output of the tokens file. This process allowed us to precisely access the tool's accuracy and to obtain useful data for the creation of our ontology vocabulary and model. <a href="https://github.com/Explorers-in-the-Chthulucene/SemioticDrifting/blob/main/workflow.ipynb">Click here</a></strong> to read the documentation about the workflow</p>

					<strong>Our initial aim was to exploit FRED's output to add semantic role labeling of the entities we extracted in the previous steps. Unfortunately, this task resulted too time-consuming and complex to preform in the contest of this project, that's why we decided to try and mimic fred's semantic notation through a more simple, semi-automated process that implied manually annotating identified Frames and Roles in the first paragraph of Chapter 7 and creating a Python pipeline to automatically create instances of entities and their relation, according to our designed Ontology model. </strong>
